	<h2>What is my power</h2>
	<p>My super power is stealth. This superpower is not given by consuming a toxic chemical or bitten by insect ,this power is a self made power that anyone can master. This is also not a imaginary powers like flying, laser shooting and speed of light. There are many names called for this superpower. They are invisible mode, silent mode, stealth mode and undetectable mode. From this power I can slip past foes and get in and out of area undetected. The people around me will be unable to detect me, I can stay unnoticed in public, and not be tracked easily.</p>

The teachers were strict on training us to become the next generation of ninjustsu. There were many students who were there to learn the way of the ninja. For acquire the power I work hard and pain and became the top student in the ninja academy. Many people fear me because I was all ways behind them without noticing by them. </p>
	<h2>What do i with this power?</h2>
